# webscrapping

‚úÖ Web Scraping Sample Project Description
I recently completed a sample web scraping project for a client who needed to extract structured data from a public directory website that contained over 10,000 paginated entries, with 12 records per page. The target data included organization names, websites, and raw text metadata.

üîß Technologies Used
Python
Playwright (for robust and headless browser automation)
Pandas (for data structuring, cleaning, and CSV export)
asyncio (for handling asynchronous scraping logic efficiently)

üß© Project Objectives
Scrape thousands of pages from a public directory
Extract key information from each entry
Handle page loading delays and pagination smoothly
Export cleaned data to a CSV format

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Implementation
Requirements Understanding & Planning
Analyzed the structure of the target website.
Identified the pagination pattern and key HTML elements to target.
Estimated the total records (10,000+ pages √ó 12 entries).

Setup & Tools

Installed and configured Playwright in an asynchronous environment.
Enabled headless=True mode for efficient scraping without a browser UI.
Used nest_asyncio to allow asyncio.run() inside environments like Google Colab.
Scraper Logic
Created a loop to visit each paginated URL dynamically.
Waited for content to load using wait_for_selector to ensure reliability.
Extracted the name, website, and full raw text from each listing.

Error Handling

Used try/except blocks to catch timeouts or missing elements.
Gracefully exited the loop when no entries were found or when a timeout was hit.
Logged page numbers during scraping to monitor progress.

Data Cleaning
Trimmed and standardized text data using Python string methods.
Extracted websites using simple pattern matching from raw text.
Ensured no duplicate or empty entries made it to the final file.

Export

Stored all extracted data in a Pandas DataFrame.
Saved the final cleaned dataset to a CSV file for easy client delivery.

üì¶ Sample Output
File: canadian_museums_100pages.csv

Fields: Name, Website, RawText

Records Extracted: Sample batch from 100 pages (1,200 entries)

üß† Key Learnings
Asynchronous scraping with Playwright improves performance significantly on large-scale projects.
Building resilient scrapers requires dynamic waits and error traps.
Data cleaning and structure is as important as extraction.
